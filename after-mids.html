                        segmentation?

                        bins nearer to 0 are dark and nearer to 1 are bright. In between are low contrast image and are present only at mid. If bins start from the left and end at right, they are high contract images.

                        if we remove all pixels from the image, no pixel is left so the image is going to be dark image. #0

                        histogram can also be used in enhancements...

    r min = 1, r max = 6
    L = 2<sup>3</sup>=8 or (0-7) so we will write the highest value i.e. 7

    putting values in the formula:- 
    S = T(r) = (r-r<sub>min</sub>)(L / r<sub>max</sub> - r<sub>min</sub>)
    S = T(r) = (r-1)(7 / 6-1) = (r-1)(7/5) = 7(r-1) / 5 which is going to be the normalized formula and we will use this formula for all the pixels present in the image.

        X-Axis | Sines | Real Part 
        Y-Axis | Cosines | Imaginary Part 

        We transform images in spatial domain to frequency domain using fourier series to make the actions faster.

        We, human can't see an image in frequency domain as its in a form of wave.

        However, we can observe images in spatial domain (x,y) which is a 2-D plane.

        all modern and fast filters are in frequency domain.
